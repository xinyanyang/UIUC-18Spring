    "## Introduction to Social Media: Web\n",
    "\n",
    "In this lesson, you will be introduced to the social media aspects of web-accessible data. While web data might be less popular than other forms of social media, the number and diversity of web accessible data sets make this form of social data among the most rich for text analysis. First, we will analyze a web page to extract data. Second, we will analyze a website as a networked resource to construct a summary document of data spread across multiple pages. As a demonstration of these concepts, we use the University of Illinois Course explorer website. This project requires programmatically accessing web data, parsing web pages, and extracting information from structured documents.\n",
